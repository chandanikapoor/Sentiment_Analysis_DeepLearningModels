"If this is true, this government and military are out of control. How can Israelis not go to the street?"
"Ah, Fox News"
Fox is often 'more balanced' on Russia-related topics than the rabidly anti-Russian British media and much of the other US media. (Though let's face it they all suck and are biased.)
Text-based article about the same interview: [John Mearsheimer: There is no two-state solution](https://unherd.com/2023/12/john-mearsheimer-there-is-no-two-state-solution/).
"Certainly the USA and Israel has worked hard to ensure that it can never happen, and Hamas being murderous dicks has helped that process immensely."
"> Certainly the USA and Israel has worked hard to ensure that it can never happen,

Exactly! The US provides the money and diplomatic cover for the Jewish-only settlements on the illegally occupied Palestinian lands, strategically placing the settlements on high ground to break up a contiguous Palestinian state. And many of the militant Jewish settlers come from Brooklyn and other places in the US.

> and Hamas being murderous dicks has helped that process immensely.

The entire reason we're talking about this is because of Hamas. Hamas did not sell out and give up their right to resist. We know that *many* of the civilian casualties were caused by Israeli forces. And we know there is much Israeli propaganda (e.g. Hamas slaughtering babies that Biden mistakenly spoke about).

Without Hamas' attack Saudi Arabia would have made peace with Israel -- that's now off the table, because Hamas. The entire Arab world is demanding a 2-state solution (fat chance) but again, all that is because of Hamas.

Israel takes hostages all the time -- they call them ""prisoners,"" thousands of Palestinians held without charges/trial. Israel issues ""torture warrants"" (some legal-sounding fiction) and assassinates Hamas leaders not caring about civilian casualties.

So Hamas planned an operation to attack the Israeli army division which shot the unarmed Palestinians protesting their open-air prison *by the hundreds* and Hamas planned and took their own hostages -- all to trade with Israel. Hell, the current governor of Gaza was an Israeli hostage who was traded in a prisoner swap. 

What Hamas didn't calculate was that Israel would react so violently, committing war crimes (protected by the US) on an unprecedented scale, bombing and slaughtering 20k civilians (with US approval).

As brutal as it's been, do you see Palestinians protesting against Hamas? I've read their popularity has *increased* because Palestinians have not given up their right to resist *Israel's illegal occupation.*

Edit: Clarity, typos."
"This is just the NY Times trying to whitewash their two years of lies about the war in Ukraine.  For two years all we got was lie after lie after lie.  Bakhmut was 2 days away from falling completely into Russian hands and The NY Times was telling us Ukraine was winning the Battle of Bakhmut. Anyone who read only the Times for coverage of the Ukraine War should have wondered how all of a sudden a country that was winning a war against a weak, feeble Russia led by a tyrannical mad man was so suddenly losing the war.  Lie after lie about Russian desertions, the Russian army's lack of ammunition, how weak the Russian army was, how low morale in the Russian army was....the lies went on and on and on.

They did the same thing with their reporting on the build up to the Iraq War.  They publish outright lies and then try to whitewash the lies when they're proven wrong.

Look at their disgraceful coverage of Israel's war in Gaza.  It's lie after lie after lie.  And watch them do the exact same thing with the war in Gaza that they're doing now with the war in Ukraine: whitewash their coverage.

The alternative left media knew Russia was winning the war in Ukraine from the start and said so.  How come they didn't know?  Because they're corrupt and merely a propaganda medium for the defense industry."
"I don't believe it, not for a second. This is the US/NYT trying to put words in Russia's mouth and increasing pressure on Russia -- that's all this is.

Over the past day Russia has grabbed a couple of larger ""chunks"" of Ukrainian territory, after months of tiny gains. That hints that the Ukrainian army may be nearing collapse. Everything is in Russia's favor -- why would they want peace?"
"If Russia withdraws from Ukraine, why not?"
But we're supposed to pretend this is not squelching free speech.
"I'm surprised USA Today ran this story.

Bethlehem cancelling Christmas is pretty close to censored news, heavily under-reported."

"That's pretty hard core.

Well... Good. The world is watching and does not like what it sees."
I understand the message here but like 99% of Gazans donâ€™t celebrate Christmas.
I guess that they are getting a lot of practice as the US & NATO use Ukraine as a testing ground for a wide range of weapons systems.
"Don't worry freedum loving Americans, our valiant military-industrial complex will build many more missiles!!! 

Just place your firstborn children on the tax table there to your right."
"But the Russians seem to be more skilled at quickly adapting.

A great example is the west's GPS-based systems, like HIMARS and the Storm Shadow cruise missiles along with the various guided artillery rounds the M-777 used to shoot (before we ran out of them).

When first introduced Russia suffered quite a bit from them. Russian command posts and supply depots were trashed by HIMARS and various ports across Crimea were hit by Storm Shadows. But then the Russians adapted and you now don't hear that news.

Now the Russian electronic warfare (EW) is so effective that when Russia launches an attack they ""blank out"" the entire electronic spectrum of Ukraine's weapons -- drones, GPS-guided munitions, etc., all cease to function.

The US is no doubt working on our own things, but right now Russia is *winning this race.*"
"Numerous western military bases, coups and invasions in the region, yet its Iran that is taking aim ?

"The headline makes it seem like iran is coming all the way to north america to shoot at ships, but they are really just haltimg trade routes down in the middle east."
They've already attacked trade ships with no relation to Israel.
Thx.

"Pretty much the same with the USA, who have been enabling Israel's war crimes and and protecting it's apartheid for decades"

"Excellent article; the West seems strangely unwilling to utilize diplomacy to address and resolve these crises, preferring instead to use ever less effective military options that aren't working and harden the attitudes of all involved.

Everything is fine."
The obvious thing to do would be for Israel to stop committing genocide. The condition set seems reasonable enough. That would be a good second option though.
Isn't Yemen the one attacking international shipping?
There are a total of 5 nations with veto power in the UN.
But only 1 abuses it and runs roughshod over the world.

I'm guessing the French won't give up their uranium colony so easily."
What -- Presidents cannot rule by decree and they have to pass laws through the legislature?!
"One of the greatest things the US did was to include the ""pacifist"" clauses into the post-WWII Japanese constitution. The idea of only a defensive army, no foreign deployments, no foreign arms sales, etc., etc. -- all that was a model for other countries.

But as the US declined we decided to inflame Japanese militarism and use it for US purposes -- something we may regret in the future.

Shame on us."
The west has a [quisling](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/quisling) to pour N.E.D. and NGO money into!
"So, anyone against Putin is a traitor?"
"No, only if they accept foreign money to push another country's political agenda."
"Talk about a fantasy article. The claim that we live by the UN Charter's principles?!

The US gov't is littered with unprosecuted war criminals and torturers, Gitmo still operates openly holding its torture victims.

Israel killed more civilians in the first month of its war than died by Russia and Ukraine in 2 years of warfare in Ukraine. But yet Putin cannot freely travel and Netanyahu can -- the many charges of Israeli war crimes ignored and ""vetoed"" by the US.

Finland and Ukraine are nothing alike. Both would be extremely offended at this vapid and ignorant take.
How are they nothing alike?
